# Main Functions

- Log In and Sign Up functions allowing the User to create an Account. Through Nodemailer Users can then activate their account to gain access. 
- Once logged in the User can then Edit their Profile Picture. Within the Edit Profile Button, Users who no longer wish to use Brckd Up services can delete their accounts. 
- From the Profile Page the User can either create new Sets or view their own sets. Editing and Deleting of their own Sets is allowed.
- The main page allows for viewing of Official Sets from Lego and Fanmade Sets from other Users. These sets cannot be edited or deleted by the User (unless they themselves are the creators of said sets)
- Pre-loading of the Parts was done using a Seed (Axios call to external Rebrickable API and Mongoose to store the parts)
